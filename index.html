    <p>On most operating systems, it is not mandatory for programs to follow the
        "system-wide" HTTP proxy. Some programs, such as browsers, do honor this
        "system-wide" HTTP proxy setting, while other programs, including bash, do not.
        That means configuring "http proxy setting" in your Control Panel (Windows) or
        System Preferences (Mac) would not result in Stack traffic going through the
        proxy.</p>
